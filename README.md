#### Movie Recommendation System ###

This is a **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** that suggests similar movies based on the movie selected by the user.  
It uses NLP techniques and cosine similarity to find the most relevant movies and also shows their posters.
We did the vectorizstion of all the movie then calculate the angle between them.
The top 5 movies which have the same or nearly close cosine are our recommended movies because this have the same keywords which describe the similarity.

---

#### Features ####
- Select a movie from dropdown
- Get Top 5 similar movie recommendations
- Movie posters displayed
- Fast & interactive UI (Streamlit)
- Simple and user friendly

---

## Tech Stack ##
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Requests API

---

##  Dataset ###
TMDB Movie Dataset  
Contains movie:
- Title
- Overview
- Genre
- Tags

Similarity is calculated using CountVectorizer + Cosine Similarity.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works?
1️⃣ Data preprocessing & creating tags  
2️⃣ Converting text into vectors  
3️⃣ Calculating similarity matrix  
4️⃣ When user selects a movie → top similar movies are shown

## How to Run Locally ##


### 1️ Clone the Repository ##
git clone=https://github.com/movie-recommender-system.git cd

#### 2 Install dependencies ###
pip install require dependencies 

### 3 Run the app 
streamlit run app.py
because we are using streamlit to convert it into web 


#### APP WILL START RUNNING IN LOCAL HOST ####
